Tutorial project for Unix system calls

Each lesson is represented by a single C-file.
The sources use C99 features, like declarations anywhere in the code.

To compile just call make:
make foo  # creates executable foo from foo.c
To run:
./foo [args]

Lessons

1. fork.c
Create 2 processes via fork(), talk through a file via open() write() read().

2. pipe.c
Create a pipe, then fork(), talk using the file-descriptors from pipe().

3. mknod.c
Create a named pipe (FIFO) with mknod(), same story.

4. stat.c
Get file info from stat(), print it.

5. link.c
Create hard and symbolic links with link() and symlink().

6. dup.c
Compares dup() vs opening a file twice.

7. red12.c
Use dup() to redirect stdout/stderr of program started via execvp().

8. udspair.c
2 processes communicate via a Unix Domain Socket created by socketpair().

9. allcaps.c
A TCP/IP daemon using getaddrinfo(), socket(), bind(), listen() and accept().
